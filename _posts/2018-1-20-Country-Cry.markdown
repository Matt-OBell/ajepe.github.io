The change we people(Nigerians) want, will never happened, the country as a whole is not yet and ready for changes.

The entire universe will never change also, technology is revolutionizing the surface of the world and people thinks: the world is changing, if you look beyound the surface, you will definitely see that, only people's words, actions, decisions,orientation and the way we do things changes, but not the real change we desire.

No matter what many people do, this world won't change, those that try to change many years ago don't leave anymore, they dine in the beyound the blues now.

Imagine a country where everyone is healthy and wealthy. A nation with no disease, a land where there are no classes of people? Such country doesn't exists.
