The most important topic in Nigeria is peace, relatively, it is one of things we don't have. What kind of peace do we seek? Not a peace enforced on the Nigerians by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave neither the security of the slave. 

What we seek is genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and to build a better life for their children, not merely peace for Negerians but peace
for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace for all time.
