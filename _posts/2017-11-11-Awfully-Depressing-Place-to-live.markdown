Nigeria academic environment, sometimes, do sounds like an awfully depressing place to live. It's a place where new ideas, unfamiliar approaches, and foreign concepts always lose. 

The only things that win are what people already known and do, even if those things are flawed and inefficient, no one cares.

If we can scratch the surface and we'll all find out that, "this world" inhabitants  are filled with pessimism and despair. They expect fresh concepts to fail. 
They assume society isn't ready for or capable of change. Even worse, they want to drag others down into their tomb. If you're hopeful and ambitious, they'll try to convince you your ideas are impossible.

They'll say you're wasting your time. Don't believe them. That world may be real for them, but it doesn't mean you have to live in it.
