I'm software developer, I develop custom Odoo Apps based on requirements amd some times for **Fun**, over the years I have acquired expertise and gather experience in Odoo development, deployment and bug fixing. 

Working with Odoo on the daily basis has made me to understand Odoo both from the User and Developer points of view.

Odoo is not just an open source ERP, it can be customized and integrated with any existing application you can think of.
